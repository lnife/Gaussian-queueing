As an exercise I want you to download the script file and all the 4 test files (I altered the 4th file so it'll show error)

you'll get an normal termination or error depending upon your gaussian input
and two directories will be created (if yor're not getting an error then error directory wont be formed)
you can see that in outut folder 

further jobs that you'll run will be saved is those two directories itself
